Welcome to Trevor's edited tutorial 13!  This file is displayed by GitHub by default when you visit the repository, as you can see.

GitHub supports Markdown (a variant called "GitHub-flavored", specifically) for formatting of this file - I'll cover that in the bonus lecture on TeX, if you don't know it.

Making a second edit here just for the history; you'll revert it later!
